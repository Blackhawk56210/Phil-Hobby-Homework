    <p>My first introduction to gaming was from my older brother. I remember him playing Donkey Kong on the Gamecube with the little plug-in bongos like an early rock band and some other stuff like DMC 3 and, I think, MGS2.
        I didn't get my first gaming console until I was, I think, around 8 when the PS3 came out, and that's when it led me to play stuff like Call of Duty and Battlefield. I met a lot of great people around that time and got into some scenarios I shouldn't have.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But when I got into high school, that's when I met my current group of friends, whom I've known for just under a decade and who I still play with today.
        Currently, we've been banging out ranked on Marvel rivals but I'm still taking out my backlog of single-player stuff when I can.
        I don't remember when I built my PC ill be honest I rarely use it for gaming since I have such little storage space and my hands are so used to a controller although that is where I played most of the Xbox originals like Halo and Gears. But stuff like Custom Zombies and Lethal Company is always fun.
        I tried playing LoL once since I had heard everyone talk about it but the first game on I got called out for throwing and kicking and I want to say I had a ban for a few days. Needless to say, I haven't touched it since.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know what else to put... Battlefield is the shit COD is ass, and JRPGs are kinda cringe not all of them are but I just can't bring myself to mess with em. Best games of all time though IMO DOOM all of them except 3 even though it has some good qualities, Dead Space all of them... yes even 3( I have the collectrors editions of the most recent ones all of them)
        and Prototype 1&2 anything the great god HIDEO KOJIMA has blessed his touch with, DMC, LEGO Star Wars the complete saga the old one, not the recent one.
        That's all I can think of.</p>
